          DBML 2026 Workshop, held in conjunction with ICDE 2026 in Montréal, Canada, explores the growing synergy
          between databases and machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advances in data management techniques have become essential for building robust, scalable ML systems.
          Applications range from data preparation and cleaning to feature engineering and managing the ML lifecycle.
          The recent rise of LLMs and RAG has only intensified demand for high-performance data infrastructure.
          Modern AI systems increasingly rely on vector databases and scalable model serving.
          Multimodal AI adds further requirements for storing and querying images, audio, and video.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the opposite direction, ML techniques are now incorporated as core components of database systems:
          query optimization, indexing, storage layout, and self-tuning.
          Long-standing challenges like cardinality estimation, operator and plan selection, and resource management
          - traditionally handled via human knowledge or heuristics - increasingly benefit from learned models.
        </p>
        <p>
          DBML 2026 brings together researchers and practitioners working at this intersection.
          We welcome work combining DB and ML strengths, ranging from foundational techniques and system design to
          practical applications and real-world deployments, including ML for scientific and data-intensive domains.
