            With the increased adoption of machine learning (ML) across applications and disciplines, a strong synergy
            between the database (DB) systems and ML communities has emerged. Steps involved in ML pipelines&mdash;such as
            data preparation and cleaning, feature engineering, and management of the ML lifecycle&mdash;can benefit
            significantly from advances in data management. For example, managing the ML lifecycle requires mechanisms
            for modeling, storing, and querying ML artifacts in a robust, scalable, and auditable manner.
          </p>

          <p>
            More recently, the advent of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has
            further intensified the need for high-performance data management infrastructures. Modern AI systems
            increasingly rely on vector databases, efficient vector search, and scalable model serving. At the same
            time, the rise of multimodal AI introduces demanding requirements for storing and querying images, audio,
            video, and other complex data types, all while maintaining low latency and high throughput for end users.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the opposite direction, ML techniques are now explored in core components of database systems, including
            query optimization, indexing, storage layout, and self-tuning. Long-standing challenges in databases&mdash;such
            as cardinality estimation, operator and plan selection, resource management, and other tasks traditionally
            handled with extensive human expertise or rigid heuristics&mdash;increasingly benefit from learned models and
            data-driven approaches.

          <p>
            DBML 2026 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working at this intersection, providing a dedicated forum for DB-inspired and ML-inspired approaches that address challenges in either or both communities. We welcome work that combines the strengths of DB and ML, ranging from foundational techniques and system designs to practical applications and real-world deployments, including ML for scientific data and other data-intensive domains.
